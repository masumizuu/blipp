## Architecture Overview

This chat application follows a modern full-stack architecture using Next.js App Router. It's built with a clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend**: React components with client-side interactivity
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes and server components
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js for secure user authentication
- **Real-time Communication**: Options for Socket.IO or optimized polling

The application uses a combination of server-side and client-side rendering to optimize performance and user experience.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Next.js**: The React framework for production that provides server-side rendering, API routes, and more
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript**: Adds static typing to JavaScript for better developer experience and code quality
- **Prisma**: Modern ORM for database access
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing user data, conversations, and messages

### Key Packages
- **next-auth**: Authentication solution for Next.js applications
- **@auth/prisma-adapter**: Adapter to use Prisma with NextAuth.js
- **bcryptjs**: Library for hashing passwords securely
- **date-fns**: Modern JavaScript date utility library
- **socket.io** (optional): Real-time bidirectional event-based communication
- **swr** (optional): React Hooks library for data fetching with caching and revalidation

### UI Components
- **shadcn/ui**: Collection of reusable UI components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Lucide React**: Icon library

## Database Schema

The database schema consists of three main models:

### User
Stores user information and authentication details:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: User's display name
- `email`: User's email address (unique)
- `password`: Hashed password
- `image`: Optional profile image URL
- Relations to messages and conversations

### Conversation
Represents a chat between two users:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `userOneId`: First participant's user ID
- `userTwoId`: Second participant's user ID
- `createdAt`: When the conversation was created
- `updatedAt`: When the conversation was last updated
- Relations to users and messages

### Message
Individual messages within a conversation:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `content`: Message text content
- `senderId`: User ID of the sender
- `receiverId`: User ID of the receiver
- `conversationId`: ID of the conversation this message belongs to
- `read`: Boolean indicating if the message has been read
- `createdAt`: When the message was sent
- `updatedAt`: When the message was last updated
- Relations to sender, receiver, and conversation

## Authentication Flow

The application uses NextAuth.js for authentication:

1. **Registration**:
   - User submits name, email, and password
   - Password is hashed using bcrypt
   - User record is created in the database
   - User is redirected to login page

2. **Login**:
   - User submits email and password
   - Server verifies credentials against database
   - If valid, JWT session is created
   - User is redirected to chat page

3. **Session Management**:
   - JWT stored in cookies maintains user session
   - `SessionProvider` makes session data available throughout the app
   - `useSession` hook provides session data to components
   - Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to login

4. **Logout**:
   - Session is destroyed
   - User is redirected to login page

## Key Components

### Authentication Components
- `app/login/page.tsx`: Login form with email/password authentication
- `app/register/page.tsx`: Registration form for new users
- `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`: NextAuth.js configuration and handlers
- `app/api/register/route.ts`: API route for user registration

### Chat Interface Components
- `app/chat/page.tsx`: Main chat page (server component)
- `app/chat/chat-layout.tsx`: Layout for the chat interface (client component)
- `app/chat/conversation-list.tsx`: List of user's conversations
- `app/chat/user-list.tsx`: List of available users to start conversations with
- `app/chat/chat-window.tsx`: Individual chat conversation view

### API Routes
- `app/api/conversations/route.ts`: Get all conversations, create new conversation
- `app/api/conversations/[conversationId]/messages/route.ts`: Get and send messages
- `app/api/users/route.ts`: Get all users (except current user)

### Utility Components
- `app/providers.tsx`: Provides context providers (SessionProvider)
- `middleware.ts`: Route protection middleware
- `hooks/use-socket.ts` (optional): Custom hook for Socket.IO integration

## Data Flow

### Conversation List Flow
1. User logs in and is redirected to `/chat`
2. `conversation-list.tsx` fetches conversations from `/api/conversations`
3. API route queries database for conversations where user is a participant
4. Conversations are displayed with last message and unread count
5. Background polling or WebSockets keep the list updated

### Messaging Flow
1. User selects a conversation from the list
2. `chat-window.tsx` fetches messages from `/api/conversations/[id]/messages`
3. API route queries database for messages in that conversation
4. Messages are displayed in the chat window
5. User types a message and submits the form
6. Message is sent to `/api/conversations/[id]/messages` via POST
7. API route creates a new message in the database
8. Real-time updates (polling or WebSockets) show the new message to both users

### Unread Messages Flow
1. When a message is received, if the conversation is not active, unread count increases
2. Unread counts are displayed as badges in the conversation list
3. When a user opens a conversation, messages are marked as read
4. API route updates the `read` status of messages in the database

## Real-time Communication

The application offers three approaches for real-time updates:

### 1. Socket.IO Implementation
- Creates persistent WebSocket connections
- Server emits events when messages are sent
- Clients listen for events and update UI accordingly
- Most efficient and truly real-time
- Requires additional server setup

### 2. Optimized Polling
- Periodically fetches new data from the server
- Compares with current state to minimize UI updates
- Only updates when there are actual changes
- Simpler to implement but less efficient

### 3. SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate)
- Modern data fetching library with built-in caching
- Automatically revalidates data at intervals
- Provides optimistic UI updates
- Good balance of simplicity and performance

## Key Features Implementation

### Send Message
- User types message in input field
- Form submission triggers `handleSendMessage` function
- Optimistic update adds message to UI immediately
- API request sends message to server
- Server stores message in database
- Real-time updates notify recipient

### Receive Message
- Real-time updates (Socket.IO, polling, or SWR) check for new messages
- When new messages arrive, they're added to the UI
- Messages are marked as read when conversation is opened

### Unread Messages Notifications
- Server tracks read status of messages
- API returns unread count for each conversation
- UI displays badge with count on conversation list
- When conversation is opened, messages are marked as read

### Responsive Design
- Media queries detect device size
- Different layouts for mobile and desktop
- Conditional rendering based on screen size
- Mobile-specific navigation with back button

## Optimization Techniques

### UI Performance
- Conditional rendering to prevent unnecessary updates
- Reference comparison to avoid re-renders
- Optimistic updates for immediate feedback
- Throttled polling to reduce server load

### Data Fetching
- SWR for intelligent caching and revalidation
- Deduplication of requests
- Comparison of data before state updates
- Optimistic updates with rollback on error

### Real-time Updates
- Socket.IO for efficient real-time communication
- Smart polling that only updates on changes
- Timestamp-based comparisons to detect changes

## Further Improvements

- Implement WebRTC for voice/video calls
- Add end-to-end encryption for messages

- Add typing indicators
- Support for file/image sharing
- Group chat functionality

### Performance Optimizations
